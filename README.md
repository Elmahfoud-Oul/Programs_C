   - **Purpose:** To compute and show the range of scores in a given dataset.
   - **Features:**
     - Calculates minimum and maximum scores.
     - Displays the results for each module.

### 3. **FCFS.c**
   - **Description:** This program implements the First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) scheduling algorithm for CPU scheduling.
   - **Purpose:** To simulate the FCFS scheduling algorithm to manage processes in a CPU queue.
   - **Features:**
     - Takes process arrival times and burst times as input.
     - Calculates the waiting time and turnaround time for each process.

### 4. **Highest_num_With_rep.c**
   - **Description:** This program finds the highest number in an array that appears more than once.
   - **Purpose:** To identify the highest repeated number in a dataset.
   - **Features:**
     - Loops through the array to find repeated numbers.
     - Compares and returns the highest repeated number.

### 5. **Num_friends.c**
   - **Description:** This program calculates the number of friends a person has, based on certain criteria.
   - **Purpose:** To simulate a social network and compute the number of friends using some conditions.
   - **Features:**
     - Takes input for the number of friends.
     - Performs calculations based on relationships.

### 6. **Show_Min_Age_Arrays.c**
   - **Description:** This program displays the minimum age in an array of ages.
   - **Purpose:** To find and show the minimum value from an array.
   - **Features:**
     - Loops through an array of integers.
     - Identifies and prints the smallest value.

### 7. **Studnet_Calcule_Module_Score.c**
   - **Description:** This program calculates the total module score for a student based on their grades.
   - **Purpose:** To calculate a studentâ€™s overall score based on the results of various modules.

     - Accepts grades for multiple modules.
     - Calculates the weighted average or total score.

### 8. **chek_whi.c**
   - **Description:** This program checks whether a number is positive, negative, or zero.
   - **Purpose:** To evaluate the nature of an integer.
   - **Features:**
     - Simple conditional checks using if-else.
     - Prints the result based on the value of the number.

### 9. **pointer_func.c**
   - **Description:** This program demonstrates the use of pointers in functions.
   - **Purpose:** To show how pointers work in C, especially when passed to functions.
   - **Features:**
     - Functions that take pointers as arguments.
     - Modifies values in memory directly via pointers.

### 10. **some_pair.c**
   - **Description:** This program finds pairs of elements in an array that add up to a given sum.
   - **Purpose:** To solve the "pair sum" problem in arrays.
   - **Features:**
     - Loops through an array to find pairs that sum to a target value.
     - Prints all such pairs.
